<b>Bay Area communities</b> that are disproportionately burdened by <b>air pollution</b> 

## Introduction
Due to the increasing intensity and frequency of wildfires, the looming threat of air pollution has grown. However, for population with lower socioeconomic status in the San Francisco Bay Area, the air pollution burden is disproportionately heavy:

For example, a <b>lack of education</b> may lead to one's unawareness of ways to protect themselves from air pollution; moreover, factors like <b>low income, unemployment and poverty</b> may limit one's access to protection such as purchasing air filtration units.

Thus, we look at <b>a combination of both the air pollution index and the SES index</b>, and pinpoint the most <b>disadvantaged communities</b> in the Bay Area â€” communities with lower socioeconomic status and endure heavier air pollution. For them, it's harder to breathe.
